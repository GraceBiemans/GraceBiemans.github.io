<h4>Hello! My name is Grace Biemans and I am currently in my third year of university and working to obtain my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. This page will serve as a portfolio of some of my work. The links will take you to the project in my GitHub.<h4>

<h4>This is the final project I did for the CMPT 353 course I took. The goal was to create a webpage and server for a CBO that allowed for certain actions. Given more time, I would have included a login for restricting use of certain features, like registering staff. I also would've improved and added to the webpage, as it is pretty basic at the moment.<h4>
